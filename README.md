# Sentimental-Analysis

Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations.

Data preprocessing is one of the critical steps in any machine learning project. It includes cleaning and formatting the data before feeding into a machine learning algorithm. For NLP, the preprocessing steps are comprised of the following tasks :

1. Tokenizing the string
2. Lowercasing
3. Removing stop words and punctuation
4. Stemming
5. Sequential modelling
